# Quadratic Equation Solver (TDD Approach)

## Overview

This project implements a quadratic equation solver using the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. The goal is to develop a function that finds the roots of a quadratic equation of the form:

\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\)

where `a`, `b`, and `c` are real numbers, and `a ≠ 0`.
